          "theory": "<p>In economic analysis, agents are rarely free to choose any outcome they desire; they are constrained by budgets, time, or resource availability. The mathematical formalization of this problem involves maximizing an objective function $f(x, y)$ subject to a constraint $g(x, y) = c$.</p><h3>The Geometric Intuition</h3><p>Consider the level curves of the objective function $f$. We wish to reach the highest possible level curve that still intersects with the feasible region defined by $g(x, y) = c$. At the optimal point $(x^*, y^*)$, the level curve of $f$ must be tangent to the constraint curve $g$. If they were not tangent, the constraint would cut through the level curve, implying there is a direction we could move along the constraint to reach a higher contour of $f$.</p><p>Mathematically, tangency implies that the gradient vectors of the objective function and the constraint function are parallel. That is, $\\nabla f(x^*, y^*) = \\lambda \\nabla g(x^*, y^*)$ for some scalar $\\lambda$. This condition, combined with the constraint itself, forms the basis of the Lagrangian method.</p><h3>The Lagrangian Function</h3><p>We define the Lagrangian function as: $$\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda) = f(x, y) - \\lambda [g(x, y) - c]$$ The First Order Conditions (FOCs) are obtained by setting the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\\lambda$ to zero. These conditions systematically recover the tangency condition and the feasibility constraint.</p><h3>Economic Interpretation of $\\lambda$</h3><p>The multiplier $\\lambda$ is not merely a mathematical artifact; it carries profound economic meaning. By the Envelope Theorem, $\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial f^*}{\\partial c}$. It represents the <strong>shadow price</strong> of the constraint: the marginal increase in the optimal value of the objective function resulting from a relaxation of the constraint by one unit. In a utility maximization context, it is the marginal utility of income.</p>",

Differentiating the identity $h_i(p, u) \\equiv x_i(p, e(p, u))$ with respect to price $p_j$ yields the Slutsky Equation: $$ \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial p_j} = \\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial p_j} - x_j \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial w} $$</p><h3>Substitution Effect (SE)</h3><p>The term $\\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial p_j}$ represents the Substitution Effect. It measures the change in demand due to a change in relative prices, holding utility constant. By the properties of the expenditure function (concavity), the own-price substitution effect $\\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial p_i}$ is always non-positive. Consumers always substitute away from the good that has become relatively more expensive.</p><h3>Income Effect (IE)</h3><p>The term $- x_j \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial w}$ represents the Income Effect. The price increase reduces real wealth effectively by $x_j$ units. The response depends on the nature of the good. For normal goods ($\\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial w} > 0$), the income effect reinforces the substitution effect (both reduce demand). For inferior goods, the income effect works in the opposite direction. If the income effect is strong enough to dominate the substitution effect, we observe a Giffen Good.</p>",

It focuses on the dynamics of capital accumulation in an economy with constant returns to scale production technology.</p><h3>The Fundamental Equation of Motion</h3><p>Assume a production function $Y = F(K, L)$ that is homogenous of degree one. In per-capita terms, $y = f(k)$. The evolution of capital per worker ($k$) is determined by the difference between investment and effective depreciation. The fundamental differential equation is: $$ \\dot{k} = s f(k) - (n + g + \\delta) k $$ Where $s$ is the savings rate, $n$ is population growth, $g$ is technological progress, and $\\delta$ is the depreciation rate. The term $(n+g+\delta)$ represents the \"break-even investment\" required to keep capital per effective worker constant.</p><h3>The Steady State</h3><p>In the steady state, $\\dot{k} = 0$. Investment equals break-even investment: $s f(k^*) = (n + g + \\delta) k^*$. This equilibrium is stable for standard production functions (Inada conditions). At this point, capital per worker is constant, but aggregate capital and output grow at rate $n+g$.</p><h3>The Golden Rule</h3><p>A central normative question is: which savings rate maximizes steady-state consumption? Since $c^* = f(k^*) - (n+g+\delta)k^*$, maximizing with respect to $k^*$ yields the first-order condition: $$ f'(k^*) = n + g + \\delta $$ This states that consumption is maximized when the marginal product of capital equals the effective depreciation rate. This is known as the Golden Rule level of capital.</p>",
